## Success Criteria

### In 2 Weeks
- [ ] Team knows about `.github/skills/`
- [ ] Someone references a skill in code review
- [ ] You've asked Copilot with skill reference

### In 1 Month
- [ ] All code reviews use `SYSTEM_CONSTRAINTS.md` checklist

- ✅ DECISION_FRAMEWORKS.md (4 major areas + decision trees)
- ✅ COMMON_PATTERNS.md (21 tested patterns with examples)
- ✅ Navigation + Setup + Strategy

### Phase 2: After First Product-Line Expansion
- [ ] PRODUCT_LINE_EXPANSION.md (step-by-step playbook)
- [ ] CONTRACT_DRIVEN_DESIGN.md (philosophy + examples)

### Phase 3: As System Matures
- [ ] TESTING_DATA_INTEGRITY.md (test patterns + fixtures)
- [ ] PERFORMANCE_PROFILING.md (measurement tools + decision trees)

### Phase 4: Ongoing
- [ ] Quarterly reviews of skills
- [ ] Add new gotchas as discovered
- [ ] Update decision frameworks based on outcomes
